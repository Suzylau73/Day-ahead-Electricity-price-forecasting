# Day-ahead-Electricity-price-forecasting
This document is focused on developing a tool that can predict the day-ahead electricity price more accurately. In order to achieve this goal, two datasets containing four years (2015-2019) of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain were been used to do exploratory data analysis.

Background: With an increase in renewable energy generation, like solar and wind power, the electricity price forecasts appear less accurate. The reason is that the volatility and variability of renewable resources lead to generation fluctuations. Therefore, energy prices must be forecasted more accurately in markets with high renewable energy penetration.
